# Music and Art

The work is about creating along with music. After clicking 4 times, creating 3 circles on the black canvas, a new canvas with one curly line cutting as the separate line. The three circles before the "door" indicate the three steps to build. The left part of the canvas is the synthesised part and the right, sampled. The key is to first click on the circles of each side and then use keyboard to interact. "A""S""D""W" can trigger different types of synthesised sound, and number 1-6 can trigger do, re, mi, fa, sol, la. Along with your music, shapes will also appear. One bonus: If you press the keys in the order of "1155665 4433221", a star will appear. (If that's not "abstract" as required, just leave it.)
